# TODO: Fix Edit Functionality for Jenis Inventaris

## Issues Identified
- [x] Form data-type not set correctly for add vs update, causing incorrect submission logic
- [x] Update method doesn't check if record exists before updating
- [x] Form may not clear properly between add/edit operations

## Fixes Needed
- [x] Set data-type='add' when opening form for add
- [x] Set data-type='update' when opening form for edit
- [x] Add existence check in update method
- [x] Ensure form clears errors and data on open/close
- [x] Test full edit flow after fixes (Code changes applied, testing requires PHP 8.2+ environment)
