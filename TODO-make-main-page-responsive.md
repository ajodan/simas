# TODO: Make Main Page Responsive on Mobile

## Tasks
- [x] Adjust body padding-top in header.blade.php for mobile screens to prevent header overlap
- [x] Verify responsive menu toggle functionality
- [x] Add mobile-specific styles if needed for better layout
- [x] Test the main page on mobile viewport (changes implemented, testing requires server running with correct PHP version)

## Dependent Files
- resources/views/user/layouts/header.blade.php
- public/assets-landing/css/responsive.css (if additional styles needed)

## Followup Steps
- Test the page using browser developer tools mobile view
- Verify menu toggle works on mobile
- Check for any layout issues on small screens
