# TODO: Make Header Menu Static

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Modify `resources/views/user/layouts/header.blade.php` to add fixed position styles to the header element
- [x] Add CSS to set body padding-top to prevent content overlap behind the fixed header
- [x] Test the header behavior on scroll to ensure it remains static

## Notes
- Header will be fixed at the top with full width and high z-index
- Background color and box-shadow added for better visibility
- Body padding-top set to approximately 120px to account for header height
